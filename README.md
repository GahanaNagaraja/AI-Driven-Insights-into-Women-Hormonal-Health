# AI-Driven-Insights-into-Women-Hormonal-Health
Developed an NLP and ML-based framework to analyze Reddit discussions on hormonal health, applying sentiment analysis, LLMs, and recommendation systems for evidence-based insights.
Project Overview: AI-Driven Insights into Women’s Hormonal Health
This project presents an NLP and Machine Learning-based framework designed to extract actionable insights from online discussions surrounding women’s hormonal health challenges, with a focus on PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and thyroid disorders. The system leverages Reddit data, integrating both unstructured user narratives and medical data to perform deep contextual analysis.
The primary goal of this project is to understand emotional patterns, behavioral triggers, and community sentiments, and ultimately provide personalized, evidence-based health recommendations.
